DESCRIPTION

This is a small library for reading the instantaneous cpu load
in many different operating systems. It started out as a part of
wmCube but as it [wmCube] got ported to more and more OS's it 
seemed tidier to put the OS-specific code into its
on package. As the name implies it is written in C++.

REQUIREMENTS/FEATURES

Supported systems and their features so far are:

    * Darwin - Basic functionality.
    * FreeBSD - Basic functionality, discarding of 'nice' processes.
    * Linux - Multiprocessor support, discarding of 'nice' processes.
    * NetBSD - Basic functionality, discarding of 'nice' processes.
    * OpenBSD - Basic functionality.
    * Solaris - Multiprocessor support.

I only test cpumoncc thoroughly on Linux so anyone running on a 
different OS/architecture please let me now if there are any bugs
or if everything's hunky dory. Suggestions, patches, more ports 
etc. are also very welcome.
