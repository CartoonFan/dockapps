These are two small programs that show how to use the cpumoncc library.

The first one, cpu, is a 'state-ful' cpu monitor that returns the average 
cpu load for the elapsed time between now and the last time you
ran the program. Useful (in a geeky way) in promts for example:

geoff@rama [CPU: 1%] ~/workspace/cpumoncc > ls
README  base  darwin  freebsd  linux  netbsd  openbsd  programs  solaris
geoff@rama [CPU: 4%] ~/workspace/cpumoncc >

This particular prompt is (in bash): 
PS1='\u@\h [CPU: `cpu`%] \w > '


The second program, cpuload, is a simple text mode cpu monitor.

To build these programs type 'make'. To install, type, as root, 'make install'.
