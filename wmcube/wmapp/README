This is WMApp, a C++ graphics library written exclusively for developing
WindowMaker dockapps.  If you like dockapps, but you also like C++ and you
are tired of trying to work with the code in wmgeneral.c, this library is
for you!

For an example program based on this library, check out the source code
in the example directory.  This program is long on eyecandy and short
on usefulness, but it gives an idea of what is possible.  "make wmexample"
to build it.

Features
--------
- Dockapp windows are set up automatically for you.
- State model: a dockapp may be in one of several states ("windows"), which
  can each look different and have different functionality
- On-the-fly clipping; no more masking xpms needed!
- Simple callback model: attach as many callback functions to each button
  as desired.  Callbacks can take arbitrary data as an argument, change
  the properties of other widgets, and even switch between dockapp states.
- You may automatically execute a list of functions (different for each window)
  at set intervals of time.  Useful for clocks, CPU load displays, etc.
- Numerous widgets, all with the familiar dockapp look.  The color scheme
  of many may be changed.  Many common WindowMaker dockapps could already
  be rewritten to use this library.

Widgets
-------
- Text box for conveying information; comes with three font sizes.
- Progress meter to show changes in a quantity, e.g. percent download.
- History display to show how a quantity changes over time, e.g. CPU load.
- Buttons (optionally with an image) that can have callback functions set
  and can be activated and deactivated.
- Images that may display an XPM icon.
- Glowing LED-type things that may be in one of four states:
  off, green, yellow, and red.
- Frames in which widgets (including other frames) may be nested.  Frames
  may have a border and / or padding between their contents.
- Sliders that may be moved up and down with the mouse wheel
  (or by clicking) to set a value.
- Canvas that may be drawn upon with various drawing functions.

Most of the above widgets may also inherit from one or more of the following
for additional features:

- Elliptical widget that clips contents to an ellipse
- Callback widget that can execute actions when clicked upon

Limitations
-----------
- Still not guaranteed not to leak memory or X resources
- API is not guaranteed to be backwards compatible when it changes
  (note the version number)
- The executables produced with this library are several times larger
  than those created using wmgeneral.c.
- WMApp does not support dynamic widget resizing.
- Text box fonts do not have lowercase letters.  (They can easily be
  implemented -- just edit the character maps in the xpm directory --
  but I think they would look quite bad due to the small fonts.)
- Changing the color of the fonts is not supported at runtime.  (You can
  of course do this at compile time by editing the font XPMs.)
