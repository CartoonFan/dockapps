DESCRIPTION
wmCube is a dockapp for monitoring the cpu load. A 3D object spins
faster/slower relative to the load and you can even design your own
objects for it. Objects can be traditional wireframe or solid shaded or 
a combination of the two.

REQUIREMENTS
wmCube uses the CpuMonitorCC (cpumoncc) library (spawned from 
previous versions of wmCube) to read the cpu load which supports a 
range of different operating systems. Further, the wmApp toolkit is 
used to do the drawing to the X server. Both cpumoncc and wmApp 
are included in the distribution, versions 0.0.1-pre1 and 0.0.4.1
respectively.

INSTALL
THIS PRE-VERSION ONLY WORKS ON LINUX! Please report
all bugs. Note though that wmCube _should_ compile on all archs
supported in earlier versions by simply editing the Makefile for
the particular OS in the cpumoncc directory as well as copying 
and modifying the main makefile. IF YOU GET WMCUBE 
WORKING IN ANOTHER OS THAN LINUX, PLEASE SEND
ME THE SUCCESSFUL MAKEFILES OR A PATCH! (sorry
for the shouting)

To install wmCube:

# make

then as root

# make install

This will install wmc-objects into /usr/share/wmcube
and the binary into /usr/local/bin.

Alternatively you can run wmcube with '-o <directory>' which will
load objects from the <directory>. More objects will
be bundled in the stable release.

USAGE

# wmcube -h

will give you a list of all availible command line options. When
running you control the program by clicking with your mouse on the
canvas where the object is displayed.

For a 3-button mouse:

First mouse button (left):
	Upper left corner: Switches between new and classic window mode.
	Left hand side: Zoom away from the object.
	Right hand side: Zoom in on the object.
	Upper edge: Scroll in the next object from below.
	Lower edge: Scroll in the previous object from above.
	In the middle (approx): Change 3d mode on object.
	
Second mouse button (middle button):
	Changes 3d mode on object.
	
Third mouse button (right):
	Sets the position of the lightsource.
	
For a 5-button mouse (mouse wheel):
Exactly the same as 3-button mouse except
that you can also zoom in/out with the wheel
(button 4 and 5).

CONTRIBUTIONS
I only test wmCube thoroughly on Linux so anyone running on a
different OS/architecture please let me now if there are any bugs.
Suggestions, patches etc. are also very welcome. If you package
wmCube for a certain distribution/OS and it is not represented on
this page feel free to send it to me. You can also send me new
objects (if they're cool) and I will include them in the next release
alt. put them up on this page. Make sure to put a comment
(new in 0.99) with your name etc in the wmc-file if you want credit 
for them.
