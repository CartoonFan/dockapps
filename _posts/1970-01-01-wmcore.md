This is a dockapp that shows the usage of each core in the system.  The dockapp
splits into two displays, the upper one showing the common usage of the system
and the lower display showing one graph per each core.

It detects the number of cores and computes the usage to be represented as a bar
graph.  wmcore works with a variable number of cores.  The display has been
tested with 1 up to 16 (simulated) cores.
