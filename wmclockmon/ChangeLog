	* src/main.c, wmclockmon-config/tools.c: fix memory-leaks reported
	by Clang's static analyser

2020-05-14  Jeremy Sowden <jeremy@azazel.net>

	* wmclockmon-cal/main.c, wmclockmon-cal/main.h,
	wmclockmon-cal/mainwindow.c, wmclockmon-cal/mainwindow.h,
	wmclockmon-config/edit.c, wmclockmon-config/edit.h,
	wmclockmon-config/main.c, wmclockmon-config/mainwindow.c,
	wmclockmon-config/mainwindow.h, wmclockmon-config/tools.c,
	wmclockmon-config/variables.h: fix global variables causing linkage
	failure

	A number of global variables are declared in headers with no
	explicit linkage.  This results in there being definitions of them
	in multiple object files and causes linking to fail under gcc-10.
	Add `extern` to the header declarations and separate declarations
	with no linkage in files where they are assigned.

	* wmclockmon-config/actions.c, wmclockmon-config/tools.c,
	wmclockmon-config/variables.h: check whether memory has been allocated
	before freeing.

	Two strings, command and light_color, were always freed even
	though they were only conditionally allocated.  This could cause
	"munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer" errors.  We fix this by keeping
	track of whether they have been allocated and only freeing if they
	have.

	* doc/wmclockmon-config.1, doc/wmclockmon.1,
	wmclockmon-config/configfile.h: fix typos pointed out by Lintian.

	In particular, we had spelling-error-in-binary and
	spelling-error-in-manpage warnings.

2016-01-28  Julien BLACHE <jblache@debian.org>

	* configure.ac, wmclockmon-cal/Makefile.am, wmclockmon-cal/mainwindow.c,
	wmclockmon-config/Makefile.am, wmclockmon-config/dialogs.c,
	wmclockmon-config/edit.c, wmclockmon-config/mainwindow.c: build against
	GTK+ 2.0.

2016-01-27  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@piedmont.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am, wmclockmon-cal/Makefile.am,
	wmclockmon-config/Makefile.am: update autotools files

	Define the DATADIR macro and make sure that the auxiliary programs
	wmclockmon-cal and wmclockmon-config are built properly.

	* debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/dirs:

	The upstream source includes some ancient Debian packaging.  Get
	rid of it.
